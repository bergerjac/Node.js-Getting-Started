/*
 Missing exports

 Notice the two different files below: app.js on the right side and high_five.js on the left.
 The code as it's written will not work, high_five isn't exporting anything.
 Add the proper exports line to have a successful high five!

// high_five.js
var highfive = function()
{
    console.log("<smack!!>");
};
